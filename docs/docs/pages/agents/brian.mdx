# Brian Agent

The `BrianAgent` is a `langchain` agent that leverages the Brian APIs and execute operations on the provided wallet.

## Usage

Creating a `BrianAgent` takes literally few lines of code:

```typescript
import { createBrianAgent } from "@brian-ai/langchain";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const agent = await createBrianAgent({
  apiKey: "your-brian-api-key",
  privateKeyOrAccount: "your-private-key-or-account",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI(),
});
```

You can also pass custom tools to the agent by passing the `tools` option:

```typescript
const agent = await createBrianAgent({
  apiKey: "your-brian-api-key",
  privateKeyOrAccount: "your-private-key-or-account",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI(),
  tools: [
    /* ...your custom tools here */
  ],
});
```

## Invoking the agent

Once the agent is created, you can invoke it with a given input:

```typescript
const response = await agent.invoke({
  input: "What is the USDC balance of orbulo.eth on Base?",
});
```

## Brian Agent toolkit

The `BrianAgent` has a set of tools that can be used to interact with the Brian APIs. Please refer to the [Brian Toolkit](/toolkits/brian) for more information.
