# CDP Agent

The `BrianCDPAgent` is a `langchain` agent that leverages the Brian APIs and execute operations on the provided Coinbase MPC-wallet.

## Usage

Creating a `BrianCDPAgent` takes few lines of code:

```typescript
import { createBrianAgent } from "@brian-ai/langchain";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const agent = await createBrianCDPAgent({
  apiKey: "your-brian-api-key",
  coinbaseApiKey: "your-coinbase-api-key-name",
  coinbaseApiKeySecret: "your-coinbase-api-key-secret",
  walletData: JSON.parse(process.env.COINBASE_WALLET_DATA!),
  llm: new ChatOpenAI(),
});
```

## Invoking the agent

Once the agent is created, you can invoke it with a given input:

```typescript
const response = await agent.invoke({
  input:
    "Deploy an ERC-20 token named BrianToken and symbol BRT with 100000 total supply",
});
```
