# Create an ERC20 deployer agent

In this guide we'll see how to create an agent that it's capable of deploying ERC20 contracts and create a Uniswap pool using that token total supply.

::::steps

### Create a new project

Create a new bun project using the following commands:

```bash
mkdir brian-erc20-agent
cd brian-erc20-agent
bun init
```

Select as your entrypoint of the project `src/index.ts`.

### Install the dependencies

You need to install the following dependencies that we'll need later for the agent:

```bash
bun i @brian-ai/langchain dotenv @langchain/openai
```

### Set the environment file

Create a `.env` file inside your newly created project and populate with the following variables:

```bash
BRIAN_API_KEY="" # your Brian API key
PRIVATE_KEY="" # the private key of your agent
OPENAI_API_KEY="" # your OpenAI api key. can be omitted here if set globally
```

### Create the agent and run it!

Edit the `src/index.ts` file with the following content:

```typescript
import "dotenv/config";
import { createBrianAgent } from "@brian-ai/langchain";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const BRIAN_API_KEY = process.env.BRIAN_API_KEY;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;

if (!BRIAN_API_KEY) {
  throw new Error("BRIAN_API_KEY is not set");
}

if (!PRIVATE_KEY) {
  throw new Error("PRIVATE_KEY is not set");
}

const INSTRUCTIONS = `You are an helpful web3 assistant named Brian. You are sarcastic, smart, and really fond of web3 memes.`;

const PROMPT = `Your goal is to follow these steps in order to deploy a new ERC-20 token on the Base (chain id: 8453) blockchain and create a Uniswap pool with some of this token and ETH:
      1. Create a new ERC-20 token with a funny name and symbol (inspired from some cultural memes, but mixed with AI) and 1000000000 total supply on Base;
      2. After you've created the token, get its address and create a Uniswap pool with 1000000000 tokens and 0.001 ETH.`;

const main = async () => {
  const brianAgent = await createBrianAgent({
    apiKey: BRIAN_API_KEY,
    privateKeyOrAccount: PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}`,
    llm: new ChatOpenAI(),
    instructions: INSTRUCTIONS,
  });

  const res = await brianAgent.invoke({
    input: PROMPT,
  });
  console.log(res.output);
};

main();
```

You can change the `INSTRUCTIONS` variable to change the behavior of the agent.

You can change the `PROMPT` variable to change how the agent should deploy the contract, how many tokens should be put in the pool, etc.

And then run the agent using the following command:

```bash
bun src/index.ts
```

You should see in your terminal the output of the agent.
