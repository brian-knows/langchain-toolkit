# Farcaster Memory Store

The Fastercaster Memory Vector Store stores the casts of a given **fid** in memory.

This vector store can be useful to give context to an agent about his pasts casts, or to make him act like an existing user on Farcaster.

## Usage

In order to use the Farcaster Memory Vector Store, you need to pass a valid `fid` and a `NEYNAR_API_KEY` for fetching the casts from Farcaster.

```typescript
import { createFarcasterMemoryVectorStore } from "@brian-ai/langchain";

const farcasterMemoryVectorStore = await createFarcasterMemoryVectorStore({
  fid: process.env.FID,
  neynarApiKey: process.env.NEYNAR_API_KEY,
});
```

### Query the store

You can use the `similaritySearch` method on the vector store to retrieve the most similar casts to a given text.

```typescript
const similarCasts = await memoryStore.similaritySearch(
  "Brian is such an awesome project!"
);
```

### Retriever

Most of the times, you want to use this store as a `retriever` for easier usage in your chains.

```typescript
const retriever = memoryStore.asRetriever({
  // optional filter
  filter,
  k: 2, // number of casts to retrieve
});
await retriever.invoke("Brian is such an awesome project!");
```

## More complex stores

In case you need a store with persisting, and the capability of filtering for metadata for example, you can check the [Farcaster Supabase Store](/vector-stores/farcaster-supabase-store).
