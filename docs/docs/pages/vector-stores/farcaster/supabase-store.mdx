# Farcaster Supabase Store

The Fastercaster Supabase Vector Store stores the casts of a given **fid** in your Supabase DB.

This vector store can be useful to give context to an agent about his pasts casts, or to make him act like an existing user on Farcaster.

## Usage

In order to use the Farcaster Database Vector Store, you need to pass a valid `fid`, a `NEYNAR_API_KEY` for fetching the casts from Farcaster, a `SUPABASE_API_KEY` and `SUPABASE_URL` to interact with your database.

### Before you start

Before you start using this store, you need to create a database on Supabase and run the following SQL to setup `pgvector` and create the necessary tables and functions:

```bash
-- Enable the pgvector extension to work with embedding vectors
create extension vector;

-- Create a table to store your documents
create table documents (
  id bigserial primary key,
  content text, -- corresponds to Document.pageContent
  metadata jsonb, -- corresponds to Document.metadata
  embedding vector(1536) -- 1536 works for OpenAI embeddings, the only available right now for this package
);

-- Create a function to search for documents
create function match_documents (
  query_embedding vector(1536),
  match_count int DEFAULT null,
  filter jsonb DEFAULT '{}'
) returns table (
  id bigint,
  content text,
  metadata jsonb,
  embedding jsonb,
  similarity float
)
language plpgsql
as $$
#variable_conflict use_column
begin
  return query
  select
    id,
    content,
    metadata,
    (embedding::text)::jsonb as embedding,
    1 - (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
  from documents
  where metadata @> filter
  order by documents.embedding <=> query_embedding
  limit match_count;
end;
$$;
```

### Using the store

```typescript
import { createFarcasterSupabaseVectorStore } from "@brian-ai/langchain";

const supabaseStore = await createFarcasterSupabaseVectorStore({
  fid: process.env.FID,
  neynarApiKey: process.env.NEYNAR_API_KEY,
  supabaseApiKey: process.env.SUPABASE_API_KEY,
  supabaseUrl: process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
});
```

### Query the store

You can use the `similaritySearch` method on the vector store to retrieve the most similar casts to a given text.

```typescript
const similarCasts = await supabaseStore.similaritySearch(
  "Brian is such an awesome project!"
);
```

### Query with filters

You can also pass an object with filters to the `similaritySearch` method to filter the results:

```typescript
const similarCasts = await supabaseStore.similaritySearch(
  "Brian is such an awesome project!",
  {
    metadata: {
      channelName: "Brian",
    },
  }
);
```

In this case, only the casts with the metadata field `channelName` equal to `Brian` will be returned.

You can currently filter on these metadata fields:

```json
{
  "author": "", // author of the cast
  "hash": "", // hash of the cast
  "timestamp": 0, // timestamp of the cast
  "hasFrames": false, // if the cast has frames or not
  "channelId": 0, // id of the channel where the cast was published
  "channelName": "", // name of the channel where the cast was published
  "parentHash": "", // hash of the parent cast
  "parentAuthor": "", // author of the parent cast
  "type": "" // type of the cast
}
```

### Retriever

Most of the times, you want to use this store as a `retriever` for easier usage in your chains.

```typescript
const retriever = supabaseStore.asRetriever({
  // optional filter
  filter,
  k: 2, // number of casts to retrieve
});
await retriever.invoke("Brian is such an awesome project!");
```
