# What are Vector Stores?

Vector stores are specialized data stores that enable indexing and retrieving information based on vector representations.

The vectors they store are called **embeddings**, and capture the semantic meaning of data that has been embedded.

Vector stores are frequently used to search over unstructured data, such as text, images, and audio, to retrieve relevant information based on semantic similarity rather than exact keyword matches.
