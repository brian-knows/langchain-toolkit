## Core Principles

### Web3 Native Agents

Autonomous agents with their own wallets represent a paradigm shift in how we interact with blockchain networks. By giving AI agents direct control over crypto wallets, we enable them to:

- Execute transactions independently
- Hold and manage digital assets
- Interact with smart contracts
- Participate in DeFi protocols
- Engage in token-gated communities

### Why Wallet-Enabled Agents Matter

In the Web3 ecosystem, having a wallet is fundamental to participation. When AI agents possess their own wallets, they become first-class citizens of the blockchain world, capable of:

1. **True Autonomy**: Agents can make financial decisions and execute them without human intervention
2. **Economic Agency**: They can hold, transfer, and manage digital assets independently
3. **Protocol Interaction**: Direct engagement with DeFi, NFTs, and other blockchain protocols
4. **Identity Management**: Wallets serve as their on-chain identity and reputation

## Integration with Brian APIs
