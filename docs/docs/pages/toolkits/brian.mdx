# Brian Toolkit

The `BrianToolkit` is a `langchain` toolkit that can be imported in your agent to interact with the Brian APIs and execute operations with a wallet.

## Usage

You can import directly the `BrianToolkit` in your agent without the need of using the `createBrianAgent` function:

```typescript
import { BrianToolkit } from "@brian-ai/langchain";

const { tools } = new BrianToolkit({
  apiKey: "your-brian-api-key",
  privateKeyOrAccount: "your-private-key-or-account",
  options: { ...brianToolkitOptions },
});

// import the tools in your langchain agent
```

The `brianToolkitOption` object is an object that can contain the following properties:

```typescript
type BrianToolkitOptions = {
  gelatoApiKey?: string;
};
```

Check the [Gelato Integration](/integrations/gelato) page for more information on how the `gelatoApiKey` option is used.

## Tools

Every tool inside the `BrianToolkit` is an object of the following class that extends the `DynamicStructuredTool` class from `langchain`:

```typescript
type BrianToolOptions = {
  gelatoApiKey?: string;
};

class BrianTool extends DynamicStructuredTool {
  brianSDK: BrianSDK;
  account: Account;
  options?: BrianToolOptions;

  constructor(
    fields: DynamicStructuredToolInput & {
      brianSDK: BrianSDK;
      account: Account;
      options?: BrianToolOptions;
    }
  ) {
    super(fields);
    this.brianSDK = fields.brianSDK;
    this.account = fields.account;
  }
}
```

Every tool this way has access to the `BrianSDK` instance and to the `Account` instance that are used to interact with the Brian APIs and the wallet respectively.

These are all the tools currently supported by the toolkit.

:::danger
**We do not encourage the use of the tools directly, but rather the import of the whole `BrianToolkit` or using the `BrianAgent` directly.**

### Balance tool

```typescript
await balanceTool.invoke({
  token: "USDC",
  chain: "Base",
  address: "orbulo.eth",
});
```

### Borrow tool

The **borrow** tool is a tool that allows the agent to borrow a given amount of a token from AAVE.

```typescript
await borrowTool.invoke({
  token: "USDC",
  chain: "Ethereum",
  amount: 100,
});
```

### Bridge tool

The **bridge** tool is a tool that allows the agent to bridge tokens from one chain to another.

```typescript
await bridgeTool.invoke({
  tokenIn: "USDC",
  inputChain: "Base",
  outputChain: "zkSync",
  amount: 100,
});
```

### Create pool tool

This tool is really powerful in combination with the `deployToken` tool.

### Deploy NFT tool

The **deploy NFT** tool is a tool that allows the agent to deploy a new NFT Smart Contract on a given chain (via chainId).

```typescript
await deployNFTTool.invoke({
  chainId: 1,
  name: "BrianNFT",
  symbol: "BNFT",
  baseURI: "https://brianknows.org",
});
```

### Deploy Token tool

The **deploy token** token is a tool that allows the agent to deploy a new ERC-20 token on a given chain (via chainId).

```typescript
await deployTokenTool.invoke({
  chainId: 1,
  name: "BrianToken",
  symbol: "BRT",
  totalSupply: 10000000,
});
```

### Deposit tool

The **deposit** tool is a tool that allows the agent to deposit a given amount of a token inside a protocol.

```typescript
await depositTool.invoke({
  tokenIn: "USDC",
  chain: "Ethereum",
  amount: 100,
  protocol: "AAVE",
});
```

### Networks tool

The **networks** tool is a utility tool that allows the agent to retrieve all the networks supported by Brian, alongside with their chain ID.

```typescript
await networksTool.invoke();
```

### Repay tool

The **repay** tool is a tool that allows the agent to repay a given amount of borrowed tokens to AAVE.

```typescript
await repayTool.invoke({
  token: "USDC",
  chain: "Ethereum",
  amount: 100,
});
```

### Swap tool

The **swap** tool is a tool that allows the agent to swap two tokens (native -> native, native -> erc20, erc20 -> native).

It also supports cross-chain swaps and swaps that specifiy an address receiver.

```typescript
await swapTool.invoke({
  tokenIn: "USDC",
  tokenOut: "ETH",
  amount: 100,
  chain: "Base",
});
```

### Transfer tool

The **transfer** tool is a tool that allows the agent to transfer a given amount of a token to a given address.

```typescript
await transferTool.invoke({
  token: "USDC",
  amount: 100,
  receiver: "orbulo.eth",
});
```

### Withdraw tool

The **withdraw** tool is a tool that allows the agent to withdraw a given amount of previously deposited tokens inside a protocol.

```typescript
await withdrawTool.invoke({
  tokenIn: "USDC",
  chain: "Ethereum",
  amount: 100,
  protocol: "AAVE",
});
```
