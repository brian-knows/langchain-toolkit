# ENS Integration

All the tools, toolkits and agents in this package that leverage the Brian APIs support the use of ENS names as addresses.

This means that you can use ENS names in place of Ethereum addresses in all the tools, toolkits and agents that interact with the Brian supported chains.

## Examples

These are some examples of agents leveraging ENS support.

### Transfering ERC-20 tokens

```typescript
await brianAgent.invoke({ input: "Transfer 100 USDC to orbulo.eth" });
```

### Swapping tokens and sending them to an ENS

```typescript
await brianAgent.invoke({
  input: "Swap 100 USDC to DAI and send them to orbulo.eth",
});
```

### Checking the balance of an ENS

```typescript
await brianAgent.invoke({
  input: "What is the USDC balance of orbulo.eth on Base?",
});
```
