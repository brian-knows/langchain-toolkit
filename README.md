A powerful TypeScript SDK for creating [Langchain](https://langchain.com) agents that can interact with the blockchain.

## üí™üèª Features

- ü§ñ AI-powered blockchain interactions
- üîÑ Cross-chain operations
- üí± Token swaps
- üåâ Token bridging
- üí∞ DeFi operations (deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay)
- üí∏ Token transfers
- üíº Balance checking
- And more...

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install @brian-ai/langchain
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```typescript
import { createBrianAgent } from "@brian-ai/agent";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const agent = await createBrianAgent({
  apiKey: "your-brian-api-key",
  privateKeyOrAccount: "your-private-key-or-account",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI(),
});

// Execute blockchain operations using natural language
const result = await agent.invoke({
  input: "Swap 100 USDC for ETH on Ethereum",
});
```

### üî© Using the Brian toolkit

You could also import directly the `BrianToolkit` in your agent without the need of using the `createBrianAgent` function:

```typescript
import { BrianToolkit } from "@brian-ai/langchain";

const { tools } = new BrianToolkit({
  apiKey: "your-brian-api-key",
  privateKeyOrAccount: "your-private-key-or-account",
});

// import the tools into your own agent
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

The SDK includes several tools for different blockchain operations:

- **Swap**: Exchange tokens on various chains
- **Bridge**: Transfer tokens across different blockchains
- **Deposit**: Deposit tokens into DeFi protocols
- **Withdraw**: Withdraw tokens from DeFi protocols
- **Borrow**: Borrow tokens from lending protocols
- **Repay**: Repay borrowed tokens
- **Transfer**: Send tokens to other addresses
- **Balance**: Check token balances

> **Note**: all the actions above will be executed by the **agent** account using the private key provided. This means that some funds could be lost in the process in case of errors.

## üîµ Using CDP Wallets

The SDK also supports the creation of Agents that use the **CDP SDK** instead of **viem** for the wallet.

```typescript
import { createBrianAgent } from "@brian-ai/langchain";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

// load the wallet data into a variable
const walletData = /* ... */

const agent = await createBrianCDPAgent({
  apiKey: "your-brian-api-key",
  coinbaseApiKey: "your-coinbase-api-key-name",
  coinbaseApiKeySecret: "your-coinbase-api-key-secret",
  walletData,
  llm: new ChatOpenAI(),
});

// Execute blockchain operations using natural language
const result = await agent.invoke({
  input: "Swap 100 USDC for ETH on Ethereum",
});
```

### üî© Using the Brian CDP toolkit

You could also import directly the `BrianCDPToolkit` in your agent without the need of using the `createBrianCDPAgent` function:

```typescript
import { BrianCDPToolkit } from "@brian-ai/langchain";

const brianCDPToolkit = new BrianCDPToolkit({
  apiKey: "your-brian-api-key",
  coinbaseApiKey: "your-coinbase-api-key-name",
  coinbaseApiKeySecret: "your-coinbase-api-key-secret",
});

// load the wallet data into a variable
const walletData = /* ... */

const { tools } = await brianCDPToolkit.setup({ walletData })

// import the tools into your own agent
```

### üõ†Ô∏è CDP Available Tools

The SDK includes several tools for different blockchain operations:

- **Swap**: Exchange tokens on various chains
- **Bridge**: Transfer tokens across different blockchains
- **Deposit**: Deposit tokens into DeFi protocols
- **Withdraw**: Withdraw tokens from DeFi protocols
- **Transfer**: Send tokens to other addresses
- **Balance**: Check token balances
- **Deploy NFT**: Deploy an NFT contract
- **Deploy Token**: Deploy an ERC-20 token
- **Faucet**: Gets some faucet tokens (only on Base Sepolia)

> **Note**: all the actions above will be executed by the **agent** account using the CDP wallet provided. This means that some funds could be lost in the process in case of errors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

The SDK is built on top of LangChain's agent framework and uses:

- [zod](https://zod.dev/) for schema validation
- [viem](https://viem.sh/) for blockchain interactions
- [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) for agent orchestration
- [Brian](https://www.brianknows.org) AI SDK for transaction processing
- [CDP SDK](https://coinbase.github.io/coinbase-sdk-nodejs/index.html) for the Brian CDP Agent
